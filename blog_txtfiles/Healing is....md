blog_content : 
Healing is...  
The sweet taste of presence  
The wide grin into the void  
The embrace of prostration  
The kind head nod to inadequacy  
The forgiveness of flaws, past  
The forgiveness of mistakes, future  
The forgiveness of disappointment, present  
Forgiveness  

The stretching of seconds  
The slow creep of warmth in a hot shower  
The permission to slow down  
Discovery at the soul's pace  
The sway of my soul to the music of my life  
The certainty in this rhythm  
The conversation with God always on the tip of my tongue  
Timeless  

The silent roll of tears  
The taste of utter reliance on God  
The restful contentment therein  
The sincere apology for the sake of God  
The sincere apology to God  
Sincerity  

Worship...made sweeter by the hurt.

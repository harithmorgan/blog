blog_content : 

We are always exactly where we are meant to be
We are exactly where we are meant to be
We are where we are meant to be
We are where we are
We are

Insisting on faith in God who has taken us so far 
Facing down the panic of uncertainty
On a plane that refuses to fly
In a mob that knows not what to do
It is hard to keep calm
I cannot help but ponder deeper realities
Cannot help but wonder

Are we?
Where are we?
Where are we meant to be?
Where are we meant to be exactly?
Where are we meant to be exactly where we are?

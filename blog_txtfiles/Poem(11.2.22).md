blog_content : 
The reservoir let loose 
escaped unseen in a trickle
forged a path of least resistance
becomes stream upon the mountainside

The stream given time
makes smooth jagged rock
carves curves into stone 
becomes river within the valley

The river that runs for centuries
will no longer run upon the mountainside
rather, it will dwell deep inside its canyon
Having tamed a mountain and set its course in stone

it is easier to raise men from amongst boys
than to teach grown boys to be men

~~The path of least resistance is seldom that of greatest triumph....~~

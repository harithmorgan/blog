Motivation for Series:

Ramadan is truly a special time. There is so much I would like to do, to become, in these blessed days. More than I can realistically achieve. Nevertheless, one my most important goals this year is to connect with the Quran.  
  
I want to spend this month reading through a translation of the Quran, taking time to think about what this book is saying to *me*.  
  
And I want to share that journey with you.  
  
For this **Ramadan series**, inshaallah, I’ll be sending out a verse each day that resonates with me and a quick reflection.  
  
I pray that there is benefit in these shares for you, I pray that this blessed month is witness to us becoming the best version of ourselves, I pray that we learn to love each other, love ourselves, and love God in this month.  
  
Bismillah,  
Harith

Day 3:
Aal-e-Imran 3:31
قُلۡ إِن كُنتُمۡ تُحِبُّونَ ٱللَّهَ فَٱتَّبِعُونِى يُحۡبِبۡكُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَيَغۡفِرۡ لَكُمۡ ذُنُوبَكُمْۗ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ

Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If you ˹sincerely˺ love Allah, then follow me; Allah will love you and forgive your sins. For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”
~ ~ ~
I want God to love me. This verse tells me that God's love is achievable--simply so. It makes sense that the way to become beloved by God is to follow the example of the man God loves most--Prophet Muhammed ﷺ.
Following the complete example of the Prophet ﷺ, i.e. following his *Sunnah*, manifests in such pure character. The people I've met who truly embody Prophetic character, I can't help but love them. It's a different kind of love too. Far from romantic, though similarly immediate. I just want to be around people like that all the time. That's the kind of community of searching for.

Day 2:  
Al-Baqarah 2:177  
لَّيۡسَ ٱلۡبِرَّ أَن تُوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمۡ قِبَلَ ٱلۡمَشۡرِقِ وَٱلۡمَغۡرِبِ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱلۡبِرَّ مَنۡ ءَامَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلۡيَوۡمِ ٱلۡأٓخِرِ وَٱلۡمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ وَٱلۡكِتَٰبِ وَٱلنَّبِيِّۦنَ وَءَاتَى ٱلۡمَالَ عَلَىٰ حُبِّهِۦ ذَوِى ٱلۡقُرۡبَىٰ وَٱلۡيَتَٰمَىٰ وَٱلۡمَسَٰكِينَ وَٱبۡنَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَٱلسَّآئِلِينَ وَفِى ٱلرِّقَابِ وَأَقَامَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتَى ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَٱلۡمُوفُونَ بِعَهۡدِهِمۡ إِذَا عَٰهَدُوا۟ۖ وَٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ فِى ٱلۡبَأۡسَآءِ وَٱلضَّرَّآءِ وَحِينَ ٱلۡبَأۡسِۗ أُوْلَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ صَدَقُوا۟ۖ وَأُوْلَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلۡمُتَّقُونَ  
  
Goodness does not consist in turning your face towards East or West. The truly good are those who believe in God and the Last Day, in the angels, the Scripture, and the prophets; who give away some of their wealth, however much they cherish it, to their relatives, to orphans, the needy, travellers and beggars, and to liberate those in bondage; those who keep up the prayer and pay the prescribed alms; who keep pledges whenever they make them; who are steadfast in misfortune, adversity, and times of danger. These are the ones who are true, and it is they who are aware of God.  
~ ~ ~  
There is so much here. What catches my attention in this verse is the encompassing nature of its prescriptions and their timelessness. Faith and some of its pillars. Sincere charity and the best recipients of it. Honoring commitments. Consistency despite the circumstances. Each of these is a life long pursuit. If I can seek to perfect just one of these(while still practicing the others) the minutes of my days would be well accounted for. Further, there’s the timelessness here. This verse was revealed over 1400 years ago, and it still rings true. Humans are still humans and the hills we must climb to tame the more sinister parts of our humanity will be what they are.

Day 1:
Al-Baqarah 2:45-46
وَٱسۡتَعِينُواْ بِٱلصَّبۡرِ وَٱلصَّلَوٰةِۚ وَإِنَّهَا لَكَبِيرَةٌ إِلَّا عَلَى ٱلۡخَٰشِعِينَ

And seek help through patience and prayer; and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive [to Allāh]

ٱلَّذِينَ يَظُنُّونَ أَنَّهُم مُّلَٰقُواْ رَبِّهِمۡ وَأَنَّهُمۡ إِلَيۡهِ رَٰجِعُونَ

Who are certain that they will meet their Lord and that they will return to Him.

I've heard this verse many times before. It's one of my mother's favorite verses. It was not until now that I'm seeing what it might mean to seek help in "patience AND prayer". There are things that I want in my life. obstacles of my own that I've been trying to overcome for a while now. I have prayed about this specifically hundreds of times perhaps. This is prayer. There must also be patience. To prayer for something time and again, and still hold the resolution that God is listening, and that Divine intervention is well on it's way. I think that's patience. May Allah makes us amongst the beautifully patient.

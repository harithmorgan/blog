Ohio behind us
“When we ask our mother how long we’ll be here,
sometimes she says for a while and sometimes
she tells us not to ask anymore
because she doesn’t know how long we’ll stay 
in the house where she grew up
on the land she’s always known.

When we ask, she tells us
this is where she used to belong
but her sister, Caroline, our aunt Kay, has moved 
to the North,
here brother Odell is dead now,
and her baby brother, Robert, says he’s almost saved 
enough money to follow Caroline to New York City.

Maybe I should go there, too, my mother says.
Everyone else, she says,
has a new place to be now.

Everyone else 
has gone away.

And now coming back home 
isn’t really coming back home at all.
“
-Jacqueline Woodson

Throughout the book Jacqueline Woodson seamlessly weaves the words of the characters into the poem. In this poem the words from her mother add layers of interpretation that complicate the emotions of the poem, rendering them more real. At once, we as readers have to interpret the literal meaning of Woodson’s mother’s words, the emotion hidden in her words, Jacqueline’s understanding of her mother’s words, and the emotions felt by child Jacqueline in hearing her mother’s words. 

This poem hits home for me–especially in my present circumstance–in so many ways. I’m home with my family, home from school and waiting for the right job opportunity. Every day I hesitate at building my life. I hesitate because it feels pointless to renew roots in a city I’ll leave any day now. I hesitate because New York means family, family has meant parents and siblings, and my siblings have their own places to be now. I hesitate because my ties to New York manifested as friends from school, and in my absence high school friends and middle school friends have built communities that may welcome me but do not have a place for me. I’m back home…and it’s not really home.
Alas, I’m here now….
As I’ve said before: life starts now. It doesn’t start on the next phase of my journey on this planet, and for that home is not a comfort I can delay until such a phase has arrived. I cannot afford to. Accepting this truth has opened my eyes to at least one truth: Life and Home are things you build, and I have all the pieces I need. 

I’m not sure what the life of this phase will look like for me yet; but I’ve got a place to sleep, I’ve got a mosque nearby, I’ve got loved ones I need to love intentionally,  I’ve got responsibilities that need tending, and now I’ve got the will to try and make something of it.

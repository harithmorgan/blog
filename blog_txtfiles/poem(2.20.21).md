<h1>Sincerity in Your Pocket</h1>by Harith Morgan

Carry sincerity in your pocket  
Sprinkle the world with seeds of love  
Soon you will find that you can fly  

Fly not upon the strength of newfound wings  
But upon the ascension of angles, heaven-bound  
Who carry the prayers of passersby 
â€”Those who have never toiled to earn your affection,  
yet they were covered by the expansive shade of your kindness  
Sprouted from a seed of love  

And so you take flight  
With every prayer that leaps from their lips  
wishing goodness for you . . . by name.

blog_content : 

Noah was laughed at
Abraham was a rejected
Jacob was lied to
Moses was disrespected

Muhammed, peace be upon him, was loved
He was trusted and well-connected
That is until
He was tasked with a Divine message

These men lived outside the prison walls 
of public opinion
and out there they found truth

Back then, 
when they sought to bring guidance to those they cared for, 
they were shunned in exchange
Today, 
we claim the mantle of progress 
but with out mass religion of watered-down faith 
and our culture that cancels dissent
it is clear
<em>nothing has changed</em>

Time and again, guidance reintroduces herself as a stranger.
So blessed be the strange.

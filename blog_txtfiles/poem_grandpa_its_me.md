<h1>Grandpa...It's Me</h1>
If I should reach the Garden, 
to praise in community
with generations that have come before
to marvel at a universe once unseen
in audience with generations still on their way
When I see them, will they know


Will great-grandpa recognize me 
    by the life I live--carved out by the dreams of his child
    
Will great-grandma see the fruits of her labor 
    in the vitality of my smile
    
Will great-great-grandpa uncover 
    the traces of lineage that tie us, in my features
    
Will great-great-grandma realize, from my posture, 
    that she had birthed revolution


When I see them, will they know
    that I long to hear their stories
    that I've hidden letters to them in my prayers
    that I've resurrected epics about them in my poems


When I see them, will they know
    that I have been searching for them
    with no map, save intuition


When I see them, will they know. . . me

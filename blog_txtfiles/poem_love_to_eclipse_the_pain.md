<h1>Love to Eclipse the Pain</h1>by Harith Morgan

Is it love that I want
Or is a trust so deep
So resounding
That I can lay the deepest parts of my being open for my beloved to hold
To shoulder
To carry
Until the weight of my worries
The pain of my existence are no longer mine alone
Are no longer mine 
At all

Is it love that I want
Or is a romantic way to give up

Maybe if I love her hard enough
She can love me in ways I still do not know how

Maybe if I love her hard enough 
We can take the sum of our affections
Build a matrix where we overwrite imperfection
And Gauss eliminate any crippling insecurity

Maybe if I love her hard enough 
I will fall in love at just the right angle that I fall out of my own head
Because the conversations up here can be overwhelming 

Maybe if I love hard enough
It will eclipse the pain 
Throbbing in this God-shaped hole in my heart
I don't know how to love God
I don't know how to love. God!
Rather...I'm trying
And I don't know if I'm doing it right
Cuz it still hurts
And my heart is still sick
And I'm still alone...most of the time

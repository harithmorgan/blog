<h1>Today Leaves Me Speechless</h1>by Harith Morgan

Two ships pass in the night
Much the same two particles pass in a cloud
And two souls pass in the street 
Each a world it's own
Each a world unknown
And their mutual unknown too is written
In the book of all things
God does write of explosions
Crash course collisions
Two world's meet in such a way that they are each forever changed

We are ships
We are particles 
We are souls
We are worlds unknown
Destined for acquaintance we can never expect
The journey of life promises random miracles
The serendipity speaks only of God's presence
For only the divine can write the story of today
...and today leaves me speechless

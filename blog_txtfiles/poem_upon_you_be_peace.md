<h1>Upon You Be Peace</h1>by Harith Morgan

Busy, busy, busy.  
He was busy as a bee  
Oh so much to do  
Oh so much to see  
His mind always running  
Restless even in his sleep  
  
He was always headed somewhere  
Always on his feet  
He could meet a crowd of strangers  
And his still not skip beat  
  
One day he met a man  
A man as different as could be  
This man was patient, always listening  
And he smiled with all his teeth  
  
This stranger gave you his full attention  
Every conversation was a treat  
The first man was never quite sure the cause  
But meeting the stranger brought him ease  
  
There was this one thing the stranger said  
Whispered in a melody  
The first asked about this phrase  
Something here piqued his curiosity  
  
The stranger shared that he was Muslim  
Saying We spread Salam when we greet  
السلام عليكم ورحمة الله  
The first man had never heard,  
So he asked what this means  
The smiling man took his hand as he explained  
It is a prayer that upon you be peace
